# LightNovelSniffer
C# .Net 4.5 Web crawler to create PDF and Epub version of online light novels.

This is a core library. It will need a proper interface to work. For now, there is only a [CLI available](https://github.com/JoshuaArus/LightNovelSniffer-CLI). A [GUI](https://github.com/JoshuaArus/LightNovelSniffer-GUI) is planned but haven't been started yet (feel free to join the adventure !)

## Instructions
### Entry Point
You program need to call the ConfigTools.InitConf function to load the Config.xml file, and initialize global variables.
Then, use the WebCrawler class as entry point to download chapters (either defined in the Config.xml file, or dynamically instantiated in your program)

### Communication
To allow the library to interact with the user or an external programm (ask information, or output some progress), classes implementing the IInput and IOutput interface are required for the WebCrawler constructor.

### Parser
New parsers (to handle new websites) can be added either to this project in the Web/Parser folder with a pull request, or dynamically loaded in the ParserFactory.
In any case, classes need to implement the IParser interface.

### Translations
Translations can be added to the project by adding Ã  Strings.**Code**.resx file to Resource folder (where **Code** is a CultureInfo code like "en-US" or "fr-FR"...). Feel free to submit your corrections, suggestions or addition in a PR.
